Reveles (<i>verb</i>) - Latin; to discover or detect.

# About
Reveles is designed to be an autonomous navigation robot. It will be capable of taking a coordinate provided to it and travel to that location using an onboard GPS sensor, in addition to ultrasonic and passive infrared (PIR) sensors. 

This project contains both a CLion .idea and Qt .pro project file for RevelesCore, and a Qt .pro project file for the GUI. Additionally there are Arduino .ino and Python .py files that are used for device communication and motor control.
