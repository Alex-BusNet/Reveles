->Determine GPS Coordinates based off of a few existing coordinates for when GPS signal is lost.
	-Will need robot speed (encoders and accelerometer) to assist in this calculation.
	-'Dead reckoning' libraries from STMicro?

->Time of Flight sensors for human detection?
->Accuracy of GPS module?
	-May need to use Accel/Encoders to help get more accurate coordinates.
	-WiFi assisted GPS?
->Task Scheduling on Arduino
	-Move some sensors to RPi?
